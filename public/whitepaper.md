By leveraging the speed and cost-effectiveness of Solana, 7affle eliminates the inefficiencies and trust issues inherent in traditional raffle systems while offering a seamless user experience.

Our platform allows anyone to create raffles, sell tickets, and distribute prizes in a verifiably fair manner. With on-chain random winner selection and automated prize distribution, 7affle ensures complete transparency and removes the need for trusted intermediaries.

**Key Features:**
- Trustless raffle creation and management
- On-chain random winner selection
- Low 5% platform fee
- Instant prize distribution
- User-friendly interface with blockchain abstraction
- Solana wallet integration

7affle serves both individual users looking to organize simple raffles and larger entities requiring secure prize distribution systems. By providing the infrastructure for fair and transparent raffles, 7affle aims to become the go-to platform for decentralized prize draws in the Solana ecosystem.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 The Problem with Traditional Raffles

Traditional raffle systems suffer from several inherent problems:

- **Lack of Transparency**: Participants cannot verify the fairness of the winner selection process.
- **High Fees**: Centralized platforms often charge substantial fees (10-30%).
- **Limited Accessibility**: Geographic restrictions often limit participation.
- **Delayed Payouts**: Winners frequently face delays in receiving their prizes.
- **Trust Requirements**: Participants must trust organizers to handle funds honestly.

Even existing blockchain raffle solutions often fall short by implementing complex token economics, charging high fees, or failing to provide a user-friendly experience.

### 1.2 Our Solution

7affle addresses these challenges by:

- **Full Transparency**: All raffle operations, including ticket sales and winner selection, occur on-chain.
- **Minimal Fees**: A fixed 5% platform fee, significantly lower than traditional alternatives.
- **Global Accessibility**: Anyone with a Solana wallet can participate.
- **Instant Settlements**: Prizes are distributed automatically after winner selection.
- **Trustless Operations**: Smart contracts ensure raffles execute exactly as coded.
- **Simplicity**: No unnecessary tokens or complex mechanisms.

### 1.3 Market Opportunity

The global lottery market was valued at approximately $300 billion in 2023, with online lotteries representing the fastest-growing segment. As blockchain technology gains wider adoption, there is significant opportunity to capture market share by addressing the inefficiencies of traditional systems.

Within the Solana ecosystem specifically, there are limited options for transparent raffle platforms, creating a gap that 7affle aims to fill. By focusing on user experience and transparency, 7affle is positioned to become the leading raffle platform in the Solana ecosystem.

## 2. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### 2.1 Solana Blockchain Foundation

7affle is built on Solana for several key reasons:

- **Speed**: ~400ms block times and 65,000 TPS enable near-instant transactions
- **Low Cost**: Transaction fees averaging less than $0.001 make micro-raffles viable
- **Scalability**: High throughput supports large volumes of concurrent raffles
- **Developer Ecosystem**: Rich tooling and libraries accelerate development
- **Security**: Proof-of-Stake consensus with Proof-of-History provides robust security

### 2.2 Smart Contract Design

The 7affle platform is powered by smart contracts written in Rust using the Anchor framework. The core components include:

#### 2.2.1 Raffle Account Structure

Each raffle is represented by a unique Program Derived Address (PDA) that stores:

```
pub struct Raffle {
    pub authority: Pubkey,        // Raffle creator
    pub name: String,             // Raffle name
    pub description: String,      // Raffle description
    pub image_url: String,        // Raffle image URL
    pub ticket_price: u64,        // Price per ticket in lamports
    pub max_tickets: u32,         // Maximum number of tickets
    pub total_tickets: u32,       // Total tickets sold
    pub start_timestamp: i64,     // Start time
    pub end_timestamp: i64,       // End time
    pub winner: Option<u32>,      // Winning ticket number
    pub winner_address: Option<Pubkey>, // Winner's wallet address
    pub is_active: bool,          // Raffle status
    pub tickets: Vec<Pubkey>,     // List of ticket holders
}
```

#### 2.2.2 Key Smart Contract Functions

- **create_raffle**: Initializes a new raffle with specified parameters
- **buy_ticket**: Allows users to purchase raffle tickets
- **draw_winner**: Selects a winner using on-chain randomness
- **claim_prize**: Distributes the prize to the winner
- **cancel_raffle**: Allows the creator to cancel a raffle (only if no tickets sold)

### 2.3 Randomness Mechanism

Winner selection uses a combination of on-chain data sources to generate randomness:

1. Recent Solana blockhash
2. Transaction timestamp
3. Raffle-specific data (total tickets, etc.)

This approach ensures that the randomness cannot be manipulated by any single party, including the raffle creator or platform operators.

### 2.4 Security Measures

- **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**: Secure custody of raffle funds
- **Access Controls**: Strict permission checks for all sensitive operations
- **Atomic Transactions**: All-or-nothing execution prevents partial states
- **Time Locks**: Enforced start and end times for raffles
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and reporting

### 2.5 Fee Structure

7affle implements a simple, transparent fee structure:

- 5% platform fee on all raffle proceeds
- Fee is deducted automatically during prize distribution
- No hidden charges or additional costs

Unlike other platforms, the fee percentage is hardcoded in the smart contract, ensuring transparency and preventing arbitrary changes.
